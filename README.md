# CSC172
All the codes for my class CSC 172: Data Structures and Algorithms

### Structure and Algorithm Codes
#### these are different data structures coded from scratch to use in place if in built libraries in my projects

URList
URArrayList
UR_Heap
UR_BST
URStack
URQueue
URPriorityQueue
URNode
URMaps
URLinkedList

### Project 1: Calculator
This project uses: URList, URLinkedList, URNode, URQueue, URStack, and URArrayList
The main class to run it is URCalculator, but all the above have to be in the same folder
Input Format in a text file: 
_1 + 1
5.2 + 1
5.2 + 1.0
1 - 1
5.2 - 1
1.0 - 5.2 _

### Project 2: Huffman Coding
This project uses: BinaryIn, BinaryOut, Huffman, and HuffmanSubmit
The main class to run it is HuffmanSubmit, but all the above have to be in the same folder
Input Format: any text or image file, to be encoded and decoded using Huffman Algorithm

### Project 3: Shortest Path Algorithm
This does not work perfectly as of yet.
This project uses: URList, URNode, URArrayList, URMaps, URPriorityQueue, Graph, Node, Edge, MapPanel, DijkstraAlgorithm, and StreetMap
The main class to run it is StreetMap, but all the above have to be in the same folder
Input Format in a text file: 
_i	i7	42.652557	-73.750875
i	i8	42.65319199999999	-73.75045999999999
i	i9	42.65354399999999	-73.75022299999999
i	i10	42.653729999999996	-73.75012699999999
i	i11	42.653852	-73.7501_
